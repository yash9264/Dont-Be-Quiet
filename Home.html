        <p>Most Indian citizens are not aware of their legal rights. This lack of awareness is among the major reasons
            because of which reporting of criminal activities is not a seamless process in India. The general perception
            about policemen is also not helpful. However, reporting of crimes that you witness is essenial.

            India has a poor reputation when it comes to reporting of criminal activity. Several crimes, particularly
            against women, go unreported. This is for a variety of socio-political reasons, but somewhere among them is
            also a misunderstanding of legal rights. India, in truth, has all the laws in place and understanding your
            rights is key to increasing reporting criminal elements in our society.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Filing An FIR</h2>
                <p class="center">In case you are the victim of a cognizable offence, the first step you would take is
                    to approach the police. The police, on receiving information, prepares a written document, known as
                    a First Information Report (FIR). The duty of the police lies in hearing the aggrieved and directing
                    him to the District Magistrate for further action. An FIR can be filed by you if you are the person
                    against whom the crime has been committed or know about an offence that has been committed. There
                    are no charges for filing an an FIR, it being a crucial document that sets the criminal justice
                    system in process.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">What can you do if your FIR is not registered?</h2>
                <p class="center" id="list1">It is illegal to not register an FIR. The remedies available are:
                <ol start="1" class="rule">
                    <li>You can meet the Superintendent of Police or other higher officers like Deputy Inspector General
                        of Police & Inspector General of Police and bring your complaint to their notice.</li>
                    <li>You can send your complaint in writing and by post to the Superintendent of Police concerned. If
                        the Superintendent of Police is satisfied with your complaint, he shall either investigate the
                        case himself or order an investigation to be made.</li>
                    <li>You can file a private complaint before the court having jurisdiction.</li>
                    <li>You can also make a complaint to the State Human Rights Commission or the National Human Rights
                        Commission if the police does nothing to enforce the law or does it in a biased and corrupt
                        manner.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

            <div class="box">

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">What is the next step after filing an FIR?</h2>
                <p class="center">
                    The police conducts investigation, which may include arrests. Once the investigation has been
                    concluded the police will record all their findings in a Challan√Ø or charge sheet. If it is deemed
                    that there is enough proof on the charge sheet the case goes to court.On the flipside, after their
                    investigations if the police conclude that there is not enough evidence or proof that a crime has
                    been committed they can close the case after justifying their reasons in court. If the police decide
                    to close the case, they are bound to inform the person who filed the FIR of their decision.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">What is a zero FIR and when should it be used?</h2>
                <p class="center">
                    A zero FIR is used for crimes such as murder,rape etc. where immediate investigation is required and
                    time cannot be wasted in reaching the police station under whose jurisdiction the crime falls. The
                    main idea of a Zero FIR is to initiate the investigation or urge the police to take their initial
                    action. Once you have lodged a Zero FIR, make sure that your complaint is not transferred to the
                    appropriate police station in your jurisdiction without any initial action or investigation.A zero
                    FIR is necessary for crimes where immediate action is required,eg in case of murder,rape etc, or
                    when the police station under whose jurisdiction the crime was committed is not easily accessible,
                    eg in case of crimes while travelling </p>

                </h2>
                <p class="center">
                    A victim or a person having knowledge about the commission of a particular crime can file a criminal
                    complaint with a competent Judicial Magistrate. This is as per provisions mentioned under Section
                    200 in the CrPC, 1973.

                <ol start="1">
                    <li>
                        If the complaint is not in written form
                        Upon receipt of the complaint, the Magistrate decides on the cognizance of the offence. Then he
                        examines, upon oath, the complainant and the witness (es), if any. The complaint is then reduced
                        to written form. The complainant and the witness(es) need to sign the same in front of the
                        Magistrate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the complaint is in written form
                        The Magistrate needs to examine the complainant and the witness unless:

                            <li>The complainant is a designated public servant in discharge of his official duties (in

                                If the Magistrate forwards the case to another Magistrate for any trial or inquiry under
                                Section 192
